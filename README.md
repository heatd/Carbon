# Carbon

## What is Carbon

Besides the chemical element that inspired the name, Carbon is an OS that is very early in development,
written mainly in C++(and some tiny bits in C or assembly), designed to be safe and provide a different
and better API than those provided by current OSes like Linux, Windows, etc.
Carbon is licensed under the MIT license.
